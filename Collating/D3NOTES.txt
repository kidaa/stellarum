How to get from an event on a d3 svg element to the data node attached
to that element:


transition().each("end", function(e) {
	    d3.select(this).each(function(d, i) {
		console.log("Hello " + d.name);
	    });
	});

use d3.select(this) to select just this element, and then call each()
on the selection, which runs a function to which is passed the data
element and the index.
