These are all fixed now.



Two problems to deal with in collating:

* current source of data is the filtered FSVO tweets in json, and
  the star_parameters.csv file, which is based off an older version of
  the output stars.csv.

  I want to be able to add in more stars which weren't tweeted and have
  them still be in alphabetical order and not get the ids out of sync.
  This was mainly because I left Delta Crucis out because it doesn't have a
  widely-used proper name, but looking on the map, Crux is weird with only
  four stars.

* Second problem is the MARKABs and MUSCIDAe - two sets of stars which 
  share proper names and are being conflated in collation.

The common element in these is the generation of ids and linking them
to names.

--> The duplicate names problems is solved: just need to fix the
    inserts problem.

Adding inserts -

- read the CSV first and collect inserts (identified as such in the id column)
  in sequence, but leave the existing IDs as they are

- loop through the CSV file and for those with IDs, pull off the JSON -
  for the inserts, get them from the CSV.  Keep a separate running total
  which is used as the final ID.
