'''Mu Columbae''' (μ Col, μ Columbae) is a [[star]] in the [[constellation]] of [[Columba (constellation)|Columba]]. It is one of the few [[Stellar classification|O-class]] stars that is visible to the unaided eye. The star is known to lie approximately 1,300 [[light year]]s from our [[solar system]] (with an error margin of a few hundred light years).

This is a relatively fast rotating star that completes a full revolution approximately every 1.5 days. (Compare this to our [[Sun]], which at only 22% of this star's diameter rotates only once every 25.4 days.) This rate of rotation is fairly typical for stars of this class.

Based on measurements of [[proper motion]] and [[radial velocity]], astronomers know that this star and [[AE Aurigae]] are moving away from each other at a [[relative velocity]] of over 200&nbsp;km/s. Their common point of origin intersects with [[Iota Orionis]] in the [[Trapezium (astronomy)|Trapezium cluster]], some two and half million years in the past. The most likely scenario that could have created these [[runaway star]]s is a collision between two [[binary star]] systems, with the stars being ejected along different trajectories radial to the point of intersection.

==Etymology==

In [[Chinese astronomy]], Mu Columbae is called 屎, [[Pinyin]]: Shǐ, meaning ''	Excrement'', because this star is marking itself and stand alone in ''Excrement'' asterism, [[Three Stars (Chinese constellation)|Three Stars]] mansion (see : [[Chinese constellation]]).<ref>{{zh icon}} [http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0607/ap060715.html AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 7 月 15 日]</ref> 屎 (Shǐ) westernized into '''She''' by R.H. Allen, with the meaning is "the Secretions" <ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/astronomy/_Texts/secondary/ALLSTA/Columba_Noae*.html Richard Hinckley Allen: Star Names — Their Lore and Meaning: Columbae]</ref>

This star, along with [[Zeta Canis Majoris|ζ CMa]], [[Lambda Canis Majoris|λ CMa]], [[Gamma Columbae|γ Col]], [[Delta Columbae|δ Col]], [[Theta Columbae|θ Col]], [[Kappa Columbae|κ Col]], [[Lambda Columbae|λ Col]] and [[Xi Columbae|ξ Col]], were '''Al Ḳurūd''' ('''ألقرد''' - ''al-qird''), the Apes.<ref>{{cite journal
