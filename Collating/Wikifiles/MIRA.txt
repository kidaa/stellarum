'''Mira''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|m|aɪ|r|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|m|ɪ|r|ə}}) also known as '''[[Omicron]] Ceti''' (ο Ceti, ο Cet), is a [[red giant]] [[star]] estimated 200-400 [[light years]] away in the [[constellation]] [[Cetus]]. Mira is a [[binary star]], consisting of the [[red giant]] Mira A along with [[Mira B]]. Mira A is also an oscillating [[variable star]] and was the first non-[[supernova]] variable star discovered, with the possible exception of [[Algol]]. Apart from the unusual [[Eta Carinae]], Mira is the brightest periodic variable in the sky that is not visible to the naked eye for part of its cycle. Its distance is uncertain; pre-[[Hipparcos]] estimates centered around 220 [[light-years]],<ref name=burnham1980>{{citation | first1=Robert | last1=Burnham, Jr. | title=Burnham's Celestial Handbook | volume=1 | publication-place=New York | publisher=Dover Publications Inc. | year=1980 | page=634 }}</ref> while Hipparcos data suggest a distance of 418 light-years, albeit with a [[margin of error]] of ~14%.

==Observation history==
Evidence that the variability of Mira was known in ancient [[History of China|China]], [[Babylon]] or [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] is at best only circumstantial.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Wilk | first=Stephen R | title=Mythological Evidence for Ancient Observations of Variable Stars | journal=The Journal of the American Association of Variable Star Observers | year=1996 | volume=24 | issue=2 | pages=129–133 | bibcode=1996JAVSO..24..129W }}</ref> What is certain is that the variability of Mira was recorded by the astronomer [[David Fabricius]] beginning on August 3, 1596. Observing what he thought was the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] (later identified as [[Jupiter]]), he needed a reference star for comparing positions and picked a previously unremarked third-magnitude star nearby. By August 21, however, it had increased in brightness by one [[Apparent magnitude|magnitude]], then by October had faded from view. Fabricius assumed it was a nova, but then saw it again on February 16, 1609.<ref>{{Cite web | last=Hoffleit | first=Dorrit | title=History of Mira's Discovery | url=http://www.aavso.org/vstar/vsots/mirahistory.shtml | accessdate=2007-08-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070405082807/http://www.aavso.org/vstar/vsots/mirahistory.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-04-05}}</ref>

In 1638 [[Johann Holwarda|Johannes Holwarda]] determined a period of the star's reappearances, eleven months; he is often credited with the discovery of Mira's variability. [[Johannes Hevelius]] was observing it at the same time and named it "Mira" (meaning "wonderful" or "astonishing," in Latin) in 1662's ''Historiola Mirae Stellae'', for it acted like no other known star. [[Ismail Bouillaud]] then estimated its period at 333 days, less than one day off the modern value of 332 days, and perfectly forgivable, as Mira is known to vary slightly in period, and may even be slowly changing over time. The star is estimated to be a 6-billion-year-old [[red giant]].

There is considerable speculation as to whether Mira had been observed prior to Fabricius. Certainly [[Algol]]'s history (known for certain as a variable only in 1667, but with legends and such dating back to antiquity showing that it had been observed with suspicion for millennia) suggests that Mira might have been known too. Karl Manitius, a translator of [[Hipparchus]]' ''Commentary on Aratus'', has suggested that certain lines from that second century text may be about Mira. The other pre-telescopic Western catalogs of [[Ptolemy]], [[al-Sufi]], [[Ulugh Beg]], and [[Tycho Brahe]] turn up no mentions, even as a regular star. There are three observations from Chinese and Korean archives, in 1596, 1070, and the same year when Hipparchus would have made his observation (134 BC) that are suggestive, but the Chinese practice of pinning down observations no more precisely than within a given [[Chinese constellation]] makes it difficult to be sure.

==System==
Mira is a binary star system that consists of a red giant (Mira A) undergoing mass loss and a high temperature [[white dwarf]] companion (Mira B) that is accreting mass from the primary. Such an arrangement of stars is known as a symbiotic system and this is the closest such symbiotic pair to the [[Sun]]. Examination of this system by the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] shows a direct mass exchange along a bridge of matter from the primary to the white dwarf. The two stars are currently separated by about 70&nbsp;[[astronomical unit]]s.<ref name=aass304_1_379>{{cite journal

===Component A===
Mira A is currently an [[asymptotic giant branch]] (AGB) star, in the thermally pulsing AGB phase.<ref name=pogge>{{cite web | last=Pogge | first=Richard | date=January 21, 2006 | url=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit2/lowmass.html | title=Lecture 16: The Evolution of Low-Mass Stars | publisher=Ohio State University | accessdate=2007-12-11 }}</ref><ref name=lopez/> Each pulse lasts a decade or more, and an amount of time on the order of 10,000&nbsp;years passes between each pulse. With every pulse cycle Mira increases in luminosity and the pulses grow stronger. This is also causing dynamic instability in Mira, resulting in dramatic changes in luminosity and size over shorter, irregular time periods.<ref>{{cite book | first=C. W. H. | last=De Loore | coauthors=Doom, C | year=1992 | title=Structure and Evolution of Single and Binary Stars | publisher=Springer | isbn=0-7923-1768-8 }}</ref>

The overall shape of Mira A has been observed to change, exhibiting pronounced departures from symmetry. These appear to be caused by bright spots on the surface that evolve their shape on time scales of 3–14 months. Observations of Mira A in the [[ultraviolet]] band by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] have shown a plume-like feature pointing toward the companion star.<ref name=lopez>{{cite conference | last=Lopez | first=B. | title=AGB and post-AGB stars at high angular resolution | booktitle=Proceedings IAU Symposium #191: Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars | year=1999 | pages=409 | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999IAUS..191..409L | accessdate=2007-12-11 }}</ref>

====Variability====
Mira A is a well-known example of a category of [[variable star]]s known as [[Mira variable]]s, which are named after this star. It (and the other ca 6,000 to 7,000 known stars of this class<ref>[ftp://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/cats/II/250/vartype.txt GCVS: vartype.txt] from the [[General Catalogue of Variable Stars|GCVS]] catalogue (statistics at the end of the file indicate 6,006 mirae and 1,237 probable mirae)</ref>) are all [[red giant]]s whose surfaces oscillate in such a way as to increase and decrease in brightness over periods ranging from about 80 to more than 1,000 days.

In the particular case of Mira, its increases in brightness take it up to about [[Apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 3.5 on average, placing it among the [[List of stars in Cetus|brighter stars in the Cetus constellation]]. Individual cycles vary too; well-attested maxima go as high as magnitude 2.0 in brightness and as low as 4.9, a range almost 15 times in brightness, and there are historical suggestions that the real spread may be three times this or more. Minima range much less, and have historically been between 8.6 and 10.1, a factor of four times in luminosity. The total swing in brightness from absolute maximum to absolute minimum (two events which did not occur on the same cycle) is 1,700 times. Interestingly, since Mira emits the vast majority of its [[solar radiation|radiation]] in the [[infrared]], its variability in that band is only about two magnitudes. The shape of its [[light curve]] is of an increase over about 100 days, and a return twice as long.<ref>{{Cite web | last=Braune | first=Werner | title=Bundesdeutsche Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Veränderliche Sterne | url=http://www.bav-astro.de/index_e.html | accessdate=2007-08-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070810065942/http://www.bav-astro.de/index_e.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-08-10}}</ref>

====Mass loss====
Ultra-violet studies of Mira by [[NASA]]'s [[Galaxy Evolution Explorer]] (Galex) space telescope have revealed that it sheds a trail of material from the outer envelope, leaving a tail 13 light-years in length, formed over tens of thousands of years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Christopher| journal=Nature|volume=448|title=A turbulent wake as a tracer of 30,000 years of Mira's mass loss history|doi=10.1038/nature06003|date=August 17, 2007|pages=780–783|accessdate=2007-12-11|pmid=17700694|last2=Seibert|first2=M|last3=Neill|first3=JD|last4=Schiminovich|first4=D|last5=Forster|first5=K|last6=Rich|first6=RM|last7=Welsh|first7=BY|last8=Madore|first8=BF|last9=Wheatley|first9=JM|issue=7155|bibcode=2007Natur.448..780M}}</ref><ref>Minkel, JR.[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=6AE74053-E7F2-99DF-353EB7B9AE43FCF6&chanID=sa007&ec=su_astro "Shooting Bullet Star Leaves Vast Ultraviolet Wake"], "The Scientific American", August 15, 2007 Accessed August 21, 2007.</ref> It is thought that a hot [[bow shock|bow-wave]] of compressed plasma/gas is the cause of the tail; the bow-wave is a result of the interaction of the stellar wind from Mira A with gas in interstellar space, through which Mira is moving at an extremely high speed of 130 kilometres/second (291,000 miles per hour).<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1538-4357/670/2/L125/22252.html|last=Wareing|first=Christopher| journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters|volume=670|issue=2|title=It's a wonderful tail: the mass-loss history of Mira|doi= 10.1086/524407|date=November 6, 2007|pages=L125–L129|last2=Zijlstra|first2=A.

===Component B===
{{Main|Mira B}}

The companion star was resolved by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] in 1995, when it was 70 [[astronomical unit]]s from the primary; results were announced in 1997. The HST ultraviolet images and later X-ray images by the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra space telescope]] show a spiral of gas rising off Mira in the direction of Mira B. The companion's [[orbital period]] around Mira is approximately 400 years.

In 2007, observations showed a [[protoplanetary disc]] around the companion, Mira B. This disc is being accreted from material in the [[stellar wind|solar wind]] from Mira and could eventually form new planets. These observations also hinted that the companion was a [[main sequence]] star of around 0.7 [[solar mass]]es and [[spectral type]] K, instead of a white dwarf as originally thought.<ref>{{Cite web | last=Than | first=Ker | title=Dying star's dust helping to build new planets | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16564325/ | accessdate=2007-08-16}}</ref>  However in 2010 further research indicated that Mira B is in fact a white dwarf.<ref>{{cite arxiv |eprint=1009.2509v1 |author1=Sokoloski |author2=Lars Bildsten |title=Evidence for the White Dwarf Nature of Mira B |class=astro-ph.SR |year=2010}}</ref>
