'''Beta Crucis''', also known as '''Mimosa''' or '''Becrux''', is the second brightest star in the [[constellation]] [[Crux]] (after [[Alpha Crucis]] or Acrux) and is the 19th [[list of brightest stars|brightest star]] in the night sky. It forms part of the prominent [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] called the Southern Cross, which appears on five national flags.<ref name=mnras386_4_1855/> Although Beta Crucis, "Becrux", is at roughly &minus;60° [[declination]], and therefore not visible north of 30°, in the time of the ancient Greeks and Romans it was visible north of 40° due to the [[precession of equinoxes]], and these civilizations regarded it as part of the constellation [[Centaurus]].<ref name=wilkinson2007/> Its modern name, [[Mimosa]], which is derived from the [[Latin]] word for "actor", may come from the flower of the same name.<ref name=kaler/>

==Properties==
Beta Crucis is believed to be the hottest first-magnitude star, with an [[apparent visual magnitude]] of 1.25. Based on [[parallax]] measurements, it is located at a distance of {{Convert|280|ly|pc|abbr=on|lk=on}} from the [[Earth]]. In 1957, German astronomer [[Wulff-Dieter Heintz]] discovered that it is a [[spectroscopic binary]] with components that are too close together to resolve with a [[telescope]].<ref name=obs77_200/> The pair orbit each other every 5 years with an estimated separation that varies from 5.4 to 12.0 [[Astronomical Unit]]s.<ref name=aaa329_137/> The system is only 8 to 11 million years old.<ref name=mnras386_4_1855/>

The primary, Beta Crucis A, is a massive star with about 16 times the [[solar mass|Sun's mass]]. The [[stellar rotation|projected rotational velocity]] of this star is about {{nowrap|35 km s<sup>–1</sup>}}. However, the orbital plane of the pair is only about 10°, which probably means the inclination of the star's pole is also likely to be low. This suggests that the [[azimuth]]al rotational velocity is quite high, at about {{nowrap|120 km s<sup>–1</sup>}}. With a radius of about 8.4 times the [[solar radius|radius of the Sun]], this would mean the star has a rotational period of only about 3.6 days.<ref name=mnras386_4_1855/>

Beta Crucis A is a known [[Beta Cephei variable]], although with an [[effective temperature]] of about 27,000&nbsp;K it is at the high end of the [[instability strip]] where such stars are found. It has three different periods of pulsation, none of which are radial. All of the pulsation periods are in the range of 4.03–4.59 hours. The star has a [[stellar classification]] of B0.5&nbsp;III, with the [[luminosity class]] of 'III' indicating that this is a [[giant star]] that has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core. The high temperature of the star's outer envelope is what gives the star the blue-white hue that is characteristic of B-type stars.<ref name=csiro/> It is generating a strong stellar wind and is probably losing about 10<sup>–8</sup> times the mass of the Sun per year, or the equivalent of the mass of the Sun every 100 million years. The wind is leaving the system with a velocity of 2,000 km s<sup>–1</sup> or more.<ref name=mnras386_4_1855/>

The secondary companion in this system may be a main sequence star with a stellar class of B2.<ref name=aaa329_137/> In 2007, a third companion was announced, which may be a low mass, pre-[[main sequence]] star. The X-ray emission from this star was detected using the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]]. Two other stars, located at angular separations of 44 and 370 [[arcseconds]], are likely optical companions that are not physically associated with the system. The Beta Crucis system may be a member of the Lower Centaurus-Crux sub-group of the [[Scorpius-Centaurus Association]].<ref name=mnras416_3108/> This is a [[stellar association]] of stars that share a common origin.<ref name=mnras386_4_1855/>

In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], {{lang|zh|十字架}} ({{lang|zh-Latn|Shí Zì Jià}}), meaning ''[[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms (近南極星區)|Cross]]'', refers to an asterism consisting of β Crucis, [[Gamma Crucis|γ Crucis]], [[Alpha Crucis|α Crucis]] and [[Delta Crucis|δ Crucis]].<ref>{{zh icon}} ''中國星座神話'', written by 陳久金.

Mimosa is represented in the flags of [[flag of Australia|Australia]], [[flag of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[flag of Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]] as one of five stars making up the [[Southern Cross]]. It is also featured in the flag of [[Brazil]], along with 26 other stars, each of which represents a state. Mimosa represents the State of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]].<ref>{{cite web
