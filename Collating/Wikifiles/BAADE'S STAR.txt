The '''Crab Pulsar''' (PSR B0531+21) is a relatively young [[neutron star]]. The star is the central star in the [[Crab Nebula]], a [[supernova remnant|remnant]] of the [[supernova]] [[SN 1054]], which was widely observed on Earth in the year 1054.<ref name=SN1054>[http://messier.seds.org/more/m001_sn.html Supernova 1054 - Creation of the Crab Nebula]</ref><ref name="PASP1942">{{citation | last=Duyvendak | first=J.

The [[optical pulsar]] is roughly 20&nbsp;km in diameter and the pulsar "beams" rotate once every 33 milliseconds, or 30 times each second.<ref name="ROSAT" /> The outflowing relativistic wind from the neutron star generates [[synchrotron emission]], which produces the bulk of the emission from the nebula, seen from [[radio waves]] through to [[gamma rays]]. The most dynamic feature in the inner part of the nebula is the point where the pulsar's equatorial wind slams into the surrounding nebula, forming a [[termination shock]]. The shape and position of this feature shifts rapidly, with the equatorial wind appearing as a series of wisp-like features that steepen, brighten, then fade as they move away from the pulsar into the main body of the nebula.  The period of the pulsar's rotation is slowing by 38 [[nanosecond]]s per day due to the large amounts of energy carried away in the pulsar wind.<ref>[http://cass.ucsd.edu/archive/public/tutorial/SN.html Supernovae, Neutron Stars & Pulsars]</ref>

The [[Crab Nebula]] is often used as a calibration source in [[X-ray astronomy]]. It is very bright in [[X-ray]]s and the [[flux density]] and [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] are known to be constant, with the exception of the pulsar itself. The pulsar provides a strong periodic signal that is used to check the timing of the X-ray detectors. In X-ray astronomy, 'crab' and 'millicrab' are sometimes used as units of flux density. A millicrab corresponds to a flux density of about 2.4x10<sup>−11</sup> [[erg]]&nbsp;s<sup>−1</sup>&nbsp;cm<sup>−2</sup> (2.4x10<sup>−14</sup> [[watt|W]]&nbsp;m<sup>−2</sup>) in the 2–10 [[kiloelectronvolt|keV]] X-ray band, for a "crab-like" X-ray spectrum, which is roughly a powerlaw in photon energy, ''I(E)''=9.5 ''E''<sup>-1.1</sup>.{{huh|date=April 2013}}{{cn|date=April 2013}}<!--interesting, but how about some units for clarity? 9.5 what?--> 
Very few X-ray sources ever exceed one crab in brightness.

==History of observation==
The Crab Nebula was identified as the remnant of SN 1054 by 1939. Astronomers then searched for the nebula's central star. 
There were two candidates, referred to in the literature as the "north following" and "south preceding" stars. In September 1942, [[Walter Baade]] ruled out the "north following" star, but found the evidence inconclusive for the "south preceding" star.<ref>{{Citation|last=Baade | first=Walter | title=The Crab Nebula|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=96|issue=|pages=188 | year=1942 |bibcode=1942ApJ....96..188B|doi=10.1086/144446 }}</ref>
[[Rudolf Minkowski]], in the same issue of [[Astrophysical Journal]] as Baade, advanced spectral arguments claiming that the "evidence admits, but does not prove, the conclusion that the south preceding star is the central star of the nebula".<ref>{{Citation | last=Minkowski | first=Rudolf | title=The Crab Nebula|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=96 | pages=199 | year=1942 | bibcode=1942ApJ....96..199M | doi=10.1086/144447 }}</ref> 

<!--It appears that it may have been Staelin, D. H., and Reifenstein, E. C., IAU Circ. No. 2110 (1968) or Richards, D., IAU Circ. No. 2114 (1968) (with a period) that is the true first published source for a pulsar but since there's no electronic online version to confirm, the Science article should remain the source for now.-->
In late 1968, David H. Staelin and Edward C. Reifenstein III reported the discovery of two pulsating radio sources "near the crab nebula that could be coincident with it" using the 300-foot [[Green Bank Telescope|Green Bank radio antenna]].<ref>{{Citation | last=Staelin | first=David H. | last2=Reifenstein, III | first2=Edward C. | title=Pulsating radio sources near the Crab Nebula | journal=Science | volume=162 | pages=1481 | year=1968|doi=10.1126/science.162.3861.1481 | pmid=17739779 | issue=3861 | jstor=1725616|bibcode = 1968Sci...162.1481S }}</ref> They were given the designations NP 0527 and NP 0532.  The period and location of the Crab Nebula pulsar NP 0532 was discovered by Richard Lovelace and collaborators November 10, 1968 at the Arecibo radio observatory.<ref>[http://www.astro.cornell.edu/pdfs/CrabPeriodDiscovery1.pdf IAU Circ. No. 2113, 1968]</ref>

A subsequent study by them including William D. Brundage also found that the NP 0532 source is located at the Crab Nebula.<ref>{{Citation|last=Reifenstein, III|first=Edward C. | last2=Staelin | first2=David H. | last3=Brundage | first3=William D. | title=Crab Nebula Pulsar NPO527 | year=1969 | journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] | volume=22| issue=7 | pages=311 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.22.311 | bibcode=1969PhRvL..22..311R}}</ref> A radio source was also reported coincident with the crab nebula in late 1968 by L.

Optical pulsations were first reported by Cocke, Disney, and Taylor using the 36-inch telescope on Kitt Peak of the Steward Observatory of the University of Arizona. <ref>{{Citation | last=Cock | first=W.

[[Jocelyn Bell Burnell]], who co-discovered the first pulsar [[PSR B1919+21]] in 1967, relates that in the late 1950s a woman viewed the Crab Nebula source at the University of Chicago's telescope, then open to the public, and noted that it appeared to be flashing. The astronomer she spoke to, Elliot Moore, disregarded the effect as [[scintillation (astronomy)|scintillation]], despite the woman's protestation that as a qualified pilot she understood scintillation and this was something else. Bell Burnell notes that the 30&nbsp;Hz frequency of the Crab Nebula optical pulsar is difficult for many people to see.<ref name="Brumfiel">{{Citation | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v448/n7157/full/448974a.html | author=Brumfiel| title=Air force had early warning of pulsars| journal=Nature| volume=448|pages=974–975| year=2007| doi=10.1038/448974a | pmid=17728726 | issue=7157 |bibcode = 2007Natur.448..974B }}</ref><ref name="Bell Burnell">"Beautiful Minds: Jocelyn Bell Burnell", BBC television documentary broadcast 7 April 2010</ref>
