'''Nu Scorpii''' (ν Sco, 14 Scorpii) is a [[star system]] in the [[constellation]] [[Scorpius]].

It is at least a quintuple star, probably a septuple,<ref>[http://www.ctio.noao.edu/~atokovin/stars/index.php?cat=HD&number=145501 Nu Scorpii], entry in the [http://www.ctio.noao.edu/~atokovin/stars/ Multiple Star Catalog]</ref> consisting of two close groups that are separated by 41 arcseconds. The brighter group, '''Nu Scorpii A''' and '''B''', is split by 1.3[[arcsecond|"]] and composed of [[stellar classification|spectral type]] B2 subgiants. The fainter pair, '''Nu Scorpii C''' and '''D''', are spectral type B8 and B9 [[main sequence]] dwarfs split by 2.4". Nu Scorpii A is itself a semi-detached [[spectroscopic binary]], having a fainter B-type companion separated by approximately 0.3 [[arcsecond|mas]].

Since it is near the [[ecliptic]], Nu Scorpii can be [[occultation|occulted]] by the [[Moon]] and, very rarely, by [[planet]]s. [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] occulted it on 14 December 1821, but will not occult it again until 2 December 2031. The last occultation by [[Venus]] took place on 27 December 1852 and the next will take place on 30 December 2095. On 29 July 1808 there was an occultation by [[Neptune]].

Nu Scorpii is the star which causes the [[reflection nebula]] cataloged as [[IC 4592]].  Reflection nebulae are actually made up of very fine dust that normally appears dark but can look quite blue when reflecting the light of energetic nearby stars.

In [[Chinese astronomy]], Nu Scorpii is called 鍵閉, [[Pinyin]]: Jiànbì, meaning ''Door Bolt'', because this star is marking itself and stand alone in ''Door Bolt'' asterism, [[Room (Chinese constellation)|Room]] mansion (see : [[Chinese constellation]]).<ref>{{zh icon}}   [http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0605/ap060508.html AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 5 月 8 日]</ref> 鍵閉 (Jiànbì), westernized into '''Keen Pi''', but the name ''Keen Pi'' was designated for the formation of [[Lambda Scorpii|λ Sco]] (Shaula) and [[Lambda Scorpii|υ Sco]] (Lesath) by R.H. Allen and the meaning is "the Two Parts of a Lock." <ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/astronomy/_Texts/secondary/ALLSTA/Scorpio*.html Richard Hinckley Allen: Star Names — Their Lore and Meaning: Scorpio]</ref>
