'''R&nbsp;Leporis'''  ('''R&nbsp;Lep'''), sometimes called '''Hind's Crimson Star''',<ref name=allen /> is a well-known [[variable star]] in the constellation [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]], near its border with [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]].   It is designated '''"R"''' in the chart to the right.<ref name=sb0 />

It is a [[carbon star]] which appears distinctly red. It is named after famous British astronomer [[John Russell Hind|J. R. Hind]], who observed it in 1845.  Its [[apparent magnitude]] varies from +5.5 to +11.7 with a period of 418&ndash;441 days; recent measurements give a period of 427.07 days.  There may be a secondary period of 40 years.<ref name=bsc2 />

R Leporis has often been reported as an intense smoky red color, although this is not pronounced when the star is near its maximum brightness. It is reddest when it is dimmest, which occurs every 14.5 months. During these periods it is a candidate for the most-visible reddest star, but this claim is questionable. The red coloration may be caused by carbon in the star's outer atmosphere filtering out the blue part of its [[visible light]] [[spectrum]].  The star's discoverer, Hind, reported that it appeared "like a drop of blood on a black field."<ref name=allen>p. 269, [http://books.google.com/books?id=5xQuAAAAIAAJ ''Star-names and their meanings''], Richard Hinckley Allen, New York: G. E. Stechert, 1899.</ref>
