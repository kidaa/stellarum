'''Gamma Cassiopeiae''' (γ Cas, γ Cassiopeiae) is the [[Bayer designation]] for a [[star]] in the northern [[circumpolar constellation]] of [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]]. Although it is a fairly bright star with an [[apparent visual magnitude]] of 2.47,<ref name=aass34_1/> it has no traditional Arabic or Latin name. However, in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], it has the name '''Tsih''', derived from the word 策 (''cè''), meaning "the whip". It is located at the center of the distinctive "W" shape that forms the constellation's [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]]. American [[astronaut]]  [[Gus Grissom|Virgil Ivan "Gus" Grissom]] nicknamed the star '''Navi''' after his own middle name spelled backwards.<ref name="navi1"/> The star was used as an easily identifiable navigational reference point during space missions.<ref name="navi2"/> Based upon [[parallax]] measurements made by the [[Hipparcos]] satellite, this star is located at a distance of roughly {{Convert|550|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on}} from Earth.<ref name=aaa474_2_653/>

==Properties==
This is an eruptive [[variable star]], whose brightness changes irregularly between +2.20 mag and +3.40 mag. It is the prototype of the class of [[Gamma Cassiopeiae variable]] stars. The [[apparent magnitude]] of this star was +2.2 in 1937, +3.4 in 1940, +2.9 in 1949, +2.7 in 1965 and now it is +2.15. At maximum intensity, γ Cassiopeiae outshines both [[α Cassiopeiae]] (magnitude +2.25) and [[β Cassiopeiae]] (magnitude +2.3). It is a rapidly spinning star with a [[projected rotational velocity]] of 300 km s<sup>–1</sup>,<ref name=mnras309_1_221/> giving it a pronounced  [[equatorial bulge]]. When combined with the star's high luminosity, the result is the ejection of matter that forms a hot circumstellar disk of gas. The emissions and brightness variations are apparently caused by this "decretion" disk.

The [[spectrum]] of this massive star matches a [[stellar classification]] of B0.5&nbsp;IVe.<ref name=apjs17_371/> A [[luminosity class]] of IV identifies it as a [[subgiant star]] that has reached a stage of its [[stellar evolution|evolution]] where it is exhausting the supply of hydrogen in its core region and transforming into a [[giant star]]. The 'e' suffix is used for stars that show [[emission line]]s of hydrogen in the spectrum, caused in this case by the circumstellar disk. This places it among a category known as [[Be star]]s; in fact, the first such star ever to be so designated.<ref name=kaler/> It has over 19<ref name=mnras410_1_190/> times the Sun's mass and is radiating as much energy as 55,000<ref name=mnras309_1_221/> Suns. At this rate of emission, the star has reached the end of its life as a [[B-type main sequence star]] after a relatively brief 8 million years.<ref name=mnras410_1_190/> The [[stellar atmosphere|outer atmosphere]] has an intense [[effective temperature]] of 30,900,<ref name=mnras309_1_221/> which is causing it to glow with a blue-white hue.

===X-ray emission===
Gamma Cassiopeiae is the prototype of a small group of stellar sources of [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray]] radiation that is about 10 times stronger than emitted from other B or Be stars. The character of the X-ray spectrum is Be "thermal", possibly emitted from plasmas of temperatures up to least ten million kelvins, and shows very short term and long-term cycles. Historically, it has been held the these X-rays might be excited by matter originating from the star, from a hot wind or a disk around the star, accreting onto the surface of a degenerate companion, such as a [[white dwarf]] or [[neutron star]]. However, there are difficulties with either of these hypotheses. For example, it is not clear that enough matter can be accreted by a white dwarf, at the distance of the purported secondary star implied by the orbital period, sufficient to power an X-ray emission of nearly 10<sup>33</sup> erg/s or 100 [[yottawatt|YW]]. A neutron star could easily power this X-ray flux, but X-ray emission from neutron stars is known to be non-thermal, and thus in apparent variance with the spectral properties.

Evidence suggests that the X-rays maybe associated with the Be star itself or caused by some complex interaction between the star and surrounding decretion disk. One line of evidence is that the X-ray production is known to vary on both short and long time scales with respect to various UV line and continuum changes associated with a B star or with circumstellar matter close to the star.<ref name="SmithRobinson1999"/><ref name="Cranmer2000"/> Moreover, the X-ray emissions exhibit long-term cycles that correlate with the light curves in the visible wavelengths.<ref name="Smith2006"/>

One intriguing property is that Gamma Cassiopeiae exhibits characteristics consistent with a strong, disordered [[stellar magnetic field|magnetic field]]. No field can be measured directly from the [[Zeeman effect]] because of the star's rotation-broadened spectral lines. Instead, the presence of this field is inferred from a robust periodic signal of 1.21 days that suggests a magnetic field rooted on the rotating star's surface. The star's UV and optical spectral lines show ripples moving from blue to red over several hours, which indicates clouds of matter being held frozen over the star's surface by strong magnetic fields. This evidence suggests that a magnetic field from the star is interacting with the decretion disk, resulting in the X-ray emission. A disk dynamo has been advanced as a mechanism to explain this modulation of the X-rays.<ref name="Robinson2002"/> However, difficulties remain with this mechanism, among which is that there are no disk dynamos known to exist in other stars, rendering this behavior more difficult to analyze.

==Companions==
Gamma Cassiopeiae is a spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of about 204 days and an eccentricity alternately reported as 0.26 and "near zero." The mass of the companion is believed to be about that of our [[Sun]].<ref name="Harmanec2000"/><ref name="Miroschnichenko2002"/>

Gamma Cassiopeiae is an [[optical double]], with a faint [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] 11 companion B about 2 arc seconds distant,<ref name="VCD"/><ref name="Nor"/> with the designation of ADS782AB,<ref name=SIMBAD/><ref>{{Cite document |title=VizieR Detailed Page |url=http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-S?HIC%204427 |publisher=[[VizieR]] |accessdate=2009-04-13}}</ref> and a further, fainter, optical companion C.<ref name="VCD"/>

The star was referenced in [[O. Henry]]'s short story ''The Skylight Room''.
