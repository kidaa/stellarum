'''Zeta Ophiuchi''' (ζ Oph, ζ Ophiuchi) is a [[star]] located in the [[constellation]] of [[Ophiuchus]]. It has an [[apparent visual magnitude]] of 2.57,<ref name=sbpes1984/> making it the third brightest star in the constellation. [[Parallax]] measurements give an estimated distance of roughly {{Convert|366|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on}} from the [[Earth]].<ref name=aaa474_2_653/>

==Properties==
ζ Ophiuchi is an enormous star with more than 19<ref name=mnras410_1_190/> times the [[solar mass|Sun's mass]] and eight<ref name=aaa442_1_263/> times its [[solar radius|radius]]. The [[stellar classification]] of this star is O9.5&nbsp;V,<ref name=an332_2_147/> with the [[luminosity class]] of V indicating that it is generating energy in its core by the [[nuclear fusion]] of hydrogen. This energy is being emitted from the outer envelope at an [[effective temperature]] of 34,000K,<ref name=aaa442_1_263/> giving the star the blue hue of an [[O-type star]].<ref name=csiro/> It is rotating rapidly and may be close to the velocity at which it would begin to break up. The [[stellar rotation|projected rotational velocity]] may be as high as {{nowrap|400<ref name=an332_2_147/> km s<sup>–1</sup>}} and it may be rotating at a rate of once per day.

This is a young star with an age of only three million years.<ref name=mnras410_1_190/> Its luminosity is varying in a periodic manner similar to a [[Beta Cephei variable]]. This periodicity has a dozen or more frequencies ranging between 1–10 cycles per day.<ref name=an332_2_147/> In 1979, examination of the spectrum of this star found "moving bumps" in its helium line profiles. This feature has since been found in other stars, which have come to be called ζ Oph stars. These spectral properties are likely the result of non-radial pulsations.<ref name=mnras309_1_221/>

This star is roughly half way through the initial phase of its [[stellar evolution]] and will, within the next few million years, expand into a red [[supergiant]] star wider than the orbit of [[Jupiter]] before ending its life in a [[supernova]] explosion leaving behind a Neutron Star or Pulsar. From the Earth, a significant fraction of the light from this star is absorbed by interstellar dust, particularly at the blue end of the spectrum. In fact, were it not for this dust, ζ Ophiuchi would shine several times brighter and be among the very brightest stars visible.<ref name=kaler/>

X-ray emissions have been detected from Zeta Ophiuchi that vary periodically. The net X-ray flux is estimated at 1.2 × 10<sup>31</sup> [[erg]] s<sup>–1</sup>. In the energy range of 0.5–10&nbsp;[[Electronvolt|keV]], this flux varies by about 20% over a period of 0.77 days. This behavior may be the result of a magnetic field in the star. The measured average strength of the longitudinal field is about {{nowrap|141 ± 45 [[Gauss (unit)|G]]}}.<ref name=an332_2_147/>

[[File:Runaway-star-zeta-ophiuchi-110125.jpg|left|thumb|Infrared image of the shockwave (yellow arc) created by the runaway star Zeta Ophiuchi in an interstellar dust cloud.]]
ζ Ophiuchi is moving through space with a [[peculiar velocity]] of 30 km s<sup>–1</sup>. Based upon the age and direction of motion of this star, it is a member of the Upper Scorpius sub-group of the [[Scorpius-Centaurus Association]] of stars that share a common origin and [[space velocity (astronomy)|space velocity]].<ref name=aaa216_1_44/> Such [[runaway star]]s may be ejected by dynamic interactions between three or four stars. However, in this case the star may be a former component of a [[binary star]] system in which the more massive primary was destroyed in a [[Type II supernova]] explosion. The [[pulsar]] PSR B1929+10 may be the leftover remnant of this supernova, as it too was ejected from the association with a velocity vector that fits the scenario.<ref name=an332_2_147/>

Due to the high [[Stellar kinematics|space velocity]] of Zeta Ophiuchi, in combination with high intrinsic brightness and its current location in a dust-rich area of the galaxy, the star is creating a bow-shock in the direction of motion.  This shock has been made visible via NASA's [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Runaway Star Plows Through Space| url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/wise/newsfeatures.cfm?release=2011-026 | accessdate=2011-01-24 }}</ref> The formation of this bow shock can be explained by a mass loss rate of about {{nowrap|1.1 × 10<sup>−7</sup>}} times the [[solar mass|Mass of the Sun]] per year, which equals the mass of the Sun every nine million years.<ref name=an332_2_147/>
