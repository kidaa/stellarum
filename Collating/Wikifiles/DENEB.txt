'''Deneb''' (α Cyg, α Cygni, [[alpha (letter)|Alpha]] Cygni) is the brightest [[star]] in the [[constellation]] [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] and one of the vertices of the [[Summer Triangle]].  It is the 19th  [[list of brightest stars|brightest star in the night sky]], with an [[apparent magnitude]] of 1.25. A blue-white supergiant, Deneb is also one of the [[List of most luminous stars|most luminous nearby stars]]. However, its exact distance (and hence luminosity) has been difficult to calculate, so it is anywhere between 54,000 and 196,000 times as luminous as the sun.

Other names include '''Arided''' and '''Aridif''', but these have fallen out of use.<!-- note - these names are so little used I am debating whether they should be in the lead at all - Casliber 4 July 2012 -->

==Visibility==
[[Image:Summer triangle.png|left|thumb|280px|The [[Summer Triangle]]]]
Deneb lies at a [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]] of a widely spaced [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] called the [[Summer Triangle]], the other two members of which are the zero-[[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] stars [[Vega]] in the constellation [[Lyra]] and [[Altair]] in [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]].<ref name=pasachoff2000>{{Cite book | first1=Jay M. | last1=Pasachoff | year=2000 | title=A Field Guide to Stars and Planets | edition=4th | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Field Guides | isbn=0-395-93431-1 | postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==Distance and physical properties==
[[File:Hertzsprung-Russel StarData.png|thumb|left|Deneb's place at top centre on the [[Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]]]]
Deneb's [[absolute magnitude]] is currently estimated as &minus;8.4, placing it among the most luminous stars known, with an estimated [[luminosity]] nearly 200,000 times that of our [[Sun]].<ref name="SCHILLER1"/>  This is towards the upper end of various published values over the last few decades.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1086/126523}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1086/156252}}</ref><ref>{{cite doi|10.1086/154405}}</ref>

Deneb's exact distance from the Earth is still rather uncertain.  The currently accepted distance of around 2,600 light-years (and the associated physical data shown in the starbox) is derived by a variety of methods, including spectral luminosity classes, atmospheric modelling, stellar evolution models, assumed membership of the [[Cyg OB7]] association, and direct measurements of angular diameter.  The original rather inaccurate [[Hipparcos]] [[parallax]] measurement<ref name=aaa323_L49/><ref name=GSM/> was not inconsistent with this distance, but the more recent re-analysis<ref name=aaa474_2_653/> gives a much larger parallax and a distance barely half the widely accepted value.  One 2008 calculation using the Hipparcos data<ref name="arxiv">{{cite arxiv

}}</ref> puts the most likely distance at 1,550 light-years, with an uncertainty of only around 10%, although parallax measurements of asymmetric, pulsating stars embedded within shells is known to be unreliable.  The controversy over whether the direct Hipparcos measurements can be ignored in favour of a wide range of indirect stellar models and interstellar distance scales is similar to the better known situation with the [[Pleiades]].<ref>{{cite doi|10.1051/0004-6361/200912202}}</ref>  The [[Gaia mission|Gaia satellite]] should provide distance measurements at least two orders of magnitude more reliable than Hipparcos and resolve many such questions, although it will not measure Deneb itself.<ref>{{cite arXiv|eprint=1202.3645|version=1|author1=Catherine Turon|author2=Xavier Luri|author3=Eduard Masana|title=Building the cosmic distance scale: From Hipparcos to Gaia|class=astro-ph.IM|year=2012}}</ref>

Even assuming the lowest estimates of distance and luminosity, Deneb is the brightest and most distant of the stars with apparent magnitude brighter than 1.5, and the most distant (by a factor of almost 2) of the 30 brightest stars. Based on its temperature and luminosity, and also on direct measurements of its tiny [[angular diameter]] (a mere 0.002 second of arc), Deneb appears to have a diameter of 100-200 times that of the Sun; if placed at the center of our Solar System, Deneb would extend halfway out to the orbit of the Earth.<ref name="kaler">[http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~kaler/sow/deneb.html Deneb by Jim Kaler at astro.uiuc.edu]</ref> It is one of the [[List of largest known stars|largest white stars]] known.

Deneb is a bluish-white star of [[stellar classification|spectral type]] A2Ia, with a surface temperature of 8,500 kelvin. Since 1943, its [[spectrum]] has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.<ref name=baas25_1319/> It is the prototype of a class of [[variable star]]s known as [[Alpha Cygni variable]]s.  Its surface undergoes non-radial fluctuations which cause its brightness and spectral type to change slightly.

Deneb's mass is estimated at 20 solar masses.<ref name="kaler" /><ref name="domeofthesky">[http://domeofthesky.com/clicks/deneb.html Deneb at domeofthesky.com]</ref>  As a blue-white [[supergiant]], its high mass and temperature mean that it will have a short lifespan and will probably go [[supernova]] within a few million years.  It has already stopped fusing [[hydrogen]] in its core. It was probably an O class star during its main-sequence lifetime and is now probably expanding into a [[red supergiant]]. As it expands, it will go through the F, G, K and M spectral types.<ref name="SCHILLER1"/>

Deneb's [[solar wind]] causes it to lose mass at a rate of 0.8 millionth of a solar mass per year, a hundred thousand times the flow rate from the Sun.<ref name="kaler" />

==Etymology and cultural significance==
The name ''Deneb'' is derived from ''dhaneb'', the Arabic for "tail", from the phrase '''ذنب الدجاجة''' ''Dhanab ad-Dajāja<sup>h</sup>'', or "tail of the hen".<ref name=allen/> Similar names were given to at least seven different stars, most notably [[Beta Ceti|Deneb Kaitos]], the brightest star in the constellation [[Cetus]]; [[Delta Capricorni|Deneb Algedi]], the brightest star in [[Capricornus]]; and [[Denebola]], the second brightest star in [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]]. All these stars are referring to the tail of the animals that their respective constellations represent.

''Denebadigege'' was used in the ''[[Alfonsine Tables]]'',<ref name=Kunitzsch86>{{cite journal|last=Kunitzsch|first=Paul|year=1986|title=The Star Catalogue Commonly Appended to the Alfonsine Tables|journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy|volume=17|issue=49|pages=89–98|bibcode=1986JHA....17...89K}}</ref> other variants include ''Deneb Adige'', ''Denebedigege'' and ''Arided''.  This latter name was derived from ''Al Ridhādh'', a name for the constellation. [[Johann Bayer]] called it ''Arrioph'', derived from ''Aridf'' and ''Al Ridf'', 'the hindmost'  or ''Gallina''.  German poet and author [[Philipp von Zesen|Philippus Caesius]]{{disambiguation needed|date=March 2012}} termed it ''Os rosae'', or ''Rosemund'' in German, or ''Uropygium'' &ndash; the parson's nose.<ref name=allen>{{cite book

In Chinese, {{lang|zh|天津}} ({{lang|zh-Latn|Tiān Jīn}}), meaning ''[[Girl (Chinese constellation)|Celestial Ford]]'', refers to an asterism consisting of Deneb, [[Gamma Cygni|γ Cygni]], [[Delta Cygni|δ Cygni]], [[30 Cygni]], [[Nu Cygni|ν Cygni]], [[Tau Cygni|τ Cygni]], [[Upsilon Cygni|υ Cygni]], [[Zeta Cygni|ζ Cygni]] and [[Epsilon Cygni|ε Cygni]].<ref>{{zh icon}} ''中國星座神話'', written by 陳久金. Published by 台灣書房出版有限公司, 2005, ISBN 978-986-7332-25-7.</ref> Consequently, Deneb itself is known as {{lang|zh|天津四}} ({{lang|zh-Latn|Tiān Jīn sì}}, {{lang-en|the Fourth Star of the Celestial Ford}}).<ref>{{zh icon}} [http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/Museum/Space/Research/StarName/c_research_chinengstars_c_d.htm 香港太空館 - 研究資源 - 亮星中英對照表], Hong Kong Space Museum.

In the Chinese love story of [[Qi Xi]], Deneb marks the [[magpie]] bridge across the [[Milky Way]], which allows the separated lovers Niu Lang ([[Altair]]) and Zhi Nü ([[Vega]]) to be reunited on one special night of the year in late summer. In other versions of the story Deneb is a fairy who acts as chaperone when the lovers meet.

Deneb is the north pole star of [[Mars]].<ref name =Barlow>a b Barlow, Nadine G. (2008). Mars: an introduction to its interior, surface and atmosphere. Cambridge planetary science. 8. Cambridge University Press. p. 21. ISBN 0-521-85226-9.</ref>
