'''Betelgeuse''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|iː|t|əl|dʒ|uː|z}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɛ|t|əl|dʒ|uː|z}}),<ref name="OED" /> also known by its [[Bayer designation]] '''Alpha Orionis''' ('''α Orionis''', '''α Ori'''), is the [[List of brightest stars|eighth-brightest]] [[star]] in the night sky and second-brightest in the constellation of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]. Distinctly reddish, it is a [[semiregular variable star]] whose [[apparent magnitude]] varies between 0.2 and 1.2, the widest range of any [[Luminosity#Magnitude|first-magnitude star]]. Betelgeuse is one of three stars that make up the [[Winter Triangle]], and it marks the center of the [[Winter Hexagon]]. The star's name is derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] {{lang|ar|يد الجوزاء}} ''{{transl|ar|Yad al-Jauzā'}}'', meaning "the Hand of ''al-Jauzā<nowiki>'"</nowiki>'', ''i.e.'' Orion, with mistransliteration into [[medieval Latin]] leading to the first character ''y'' being misread as a ''b''.

The star is classified as a [[red supergiant]] of [[Stellar classification#Spectral types|spectral type]] M2Iab and is one of the [[List of largest known stars|largest]] and most [[Luminosity#Astronomy|luminous]] observable stars. If Betelgeuse were at the center of the Solar System, its surface would extend past the asteroid belt, possibly to the orbit of Jupiter and beyond, wholly engulfing Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. Estimates of its mass are poorly constrained, but range from 5 to 30 times that of the Sun. Its distance from Earth was estimated in 2008 at 640 [[light-year]]s, yielding a mean [[absolute magnitude]] of about −6.02. Less than 10 million years old, Betelgeuse has evolved rapidly because of its high mass. Having been ejected from its birthplace in the [[Orion OB1 Association]]—which includes the stars in [[Orion's Belt]]—this crimson [[Stellar kinematics#Runaway stars|runaway]] has been observed moving through the [[interstellar medium]] at a [[supersonic speed]] of 30&nbsp;km/sec, creating a [[bow shock]] over 4 light-years wide. Currently in a late stage of [[stellar evolution]], the supergiant is expected to proceed through its life cycle before exploding as a [[type II supernova]] within the next million years.

In 1920, Betelgeuse became the second star (after the Sun) whose angular size of its [[photosphere]] had been measured. Since then, researchers have used [[telescope]]s with different technical parameters to measure the stellar giant, often with conflicting results. Studies since 1990 have produced an [[angular diameter]] (apparent size) ranging from 0.043 to 0.056 [[arcseconds]], an incongruity largely caused by the star's tendency to periodically change shape. Due to [[limb darkening]], [[Stellar pulsations|variability]], and angular diameters that vary with [[Electromagnetic radiation|wavelength]], many of the star's properties are not yet known with any certainty. Adding to these challenges, the surface of Betelgeuse is obscured by a complex, asymmetric [[circumstellar envelope|envelope]] roughly 250 times the size of the star, caused by colossal [[stellar mass loss|mass loss]].

== Observational history ==
Betelgeuse and its red coloration have been noted since [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]; the classical astronomer [[Ptolemy]] described its color as ὑπόκιρρος (''hypókirros''), a term that was later described by a translator of [[Ulugh Beg]]'s ''[[Zij-i Sultani]]'' as ''rubedo'', [[Latin]] for "ruddiness".<ref name="allen" /><ref>''Stella lucida in umero dextro, quae ad rubedinem vergit.'' "Bright star in right shoulder, which inclines to ruddiness."</ref> In the nineteenth century, before modern systems of [[stellar classification]], [[Angelo Secchi]] included Betelgeuse as one of the prototypes for his [[Stellar classification#Secchi classes|Class III]] (orange to red) stars.<ref>{{cite conference

=== Nascent discoveries ===
[[File:Sir John Herschel with Cap, by Julia Margaret Cameron.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Portrait of [[John Herschel|Sir John Herschel]] in 1867]]
The variation in Betelgeuse's brightness was first described in 1836 by [[John Herschel|Sir John Herschel]], when he published his observations in ''Outlines of Astronomy''. From 1836 to 1840, he noticed significant changes in magnitude when Betelgeuse outshone Rigel in October 1837 and again in November 1839.<ref name="wilk99" /> A 10-year quiescent period followed; then in 1849, Herschel noted another short cycle of variability, which peaked in 1852. Later observers recorded unusually high [[Maxima and minima|maxima]] with an interval of years, but only small variations from 1957 to 1967. The records of the [[American Association of Variable Star Observers]] (AAVSO) show a maximum [[apparent magnitude|brightness]] of 0.2 in 1933 and 1942, and a minimum of 1.2, observed in 1927 and 1941.<ref name="AAVSO">{{cite web

In 1920, [[Albert Abraham Michelson|Albert Michelson]] and [[Francis G. Pease|Francis Pease]] mounted a 6-meter [[Interferometry|interferometer]] on the front of the 2.5-meter [[telescope]] at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]]. Helped by [[John August Anderson|John Anderson]], the trio measured the angular diameter of Betelgeuse at 0.047[[arcsecond|"]], a figure which resulted in a diameter of 3.84&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;km (2.58 [[Astronomical Unit|AU]]) based on the [[stellar parallax|parallax]] value of 0.018[[arcsecond|"]].<ref name="MICHELSON">{{cite journal

Beginning with this first [[Angular diameter|angular]] measurement at [[Visible spectrum|visible wavelengths]], researchers have since attempted to measure Betelgeuse's angular diameter at other wavelengths with varying results.{{Citation needed|date = November 2012}}

The 1970s saw some major advances in astronomical imaging technology beginning with [[Antoine Émile Henry Labeyrie|Antoine Labeyrie]]'s invention of [[speckle interferometry]], a process that significantly reduced the blurring effect caused by [[astronomical seeing]].

== Visibility ==
[[File:Orion Head to Toe - Reduced.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph from [[Rogelio Bernal Andreo]] showing Betelgeuse in relationship to the dense nebulas of the [[Orion Molecular Cloud Complex]] and [[Orion's Belt]]]]
In the night sky, Betelgeuse is easy to spot with the naked eye owing to its proximity to the [[Orion's Belt|belt of Orion]] and distinctive orange-red color. In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], beginning in January of each year, it can be seen rising in the east just after sunset. By mid-March, it is visible to virtually every inhabited region of the globe, except for few research stations in [[Antarctica]] at latitudes south of 82°. In May, the red giant can be seen briefly on the western horizon after sunset, reappearing again a few months later on the eastern horizon before sunrise.

The apparent magnitude of Betelgeuse is listed in the astronomical database [[SIMBAD]] at 0.42, making it on average the [[list of brightest stars|eighth brightest star]] in the [[celestial sphere]] excluding the Sun. Because Betelgeuse is a variable star whose brightness ranges between 0.2 and 1.2, there are periods when it will surpass [[Procyon]] to become the seventh brightest star. Occasionally it can even outshine Rigel and become the sixth brightest star, as the latter star, with a nominal apparent magnitude of 0.12, has been reported to fluctuate slightly in brightness, by 0.03 to 0.3 magnitudes.<ref name="bsc1">{{cite web|url=http://webviz.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-5?-out.add=.&-source=V/50/catalog&recno=1713 |title= HR 1713, database entry |work= The Bright Star Catalogue, 5th Revised Ed.

Betelgeuse has a [[color index]] (B–V) of 1.85—a figure which points to its advanced "redness." The photosphere has an extended [[Stellar atmosphere|atmosphere]], which displays strong lines of [[Spectral line|emission]] rather than [[Spectral line|absorption]], a phenomenon that occurs when a star is surrounded by a thick gaseous envelope. This extended gaseous atmosphere has been observed moving away from and towards Betelgeuse, depending on radial velocity fluctuations in the photosphere.

=== Parallax ===
Since the first successful parallax measurement by [[Friedrich Bessel]] in 1838, astronomers have been puzzled by Betelgeuse's apparent distance. Knowledge of the star's distance improves the accuracy of other stellar parameters, such as [[Luminosity#In astronomy|luminosity]] that, when combined with an angular diameter, can be used to calculate the physical radius and [[effective temperature]]; luminosity and [[Natural abundance|isotopic abundances]] can also be used to estimate the [[Stellar evolution|stellar age]] and [[Star#Mass|mass]].<ref name="HARPER">{{cite journal

=== Variability ===
[[File:Betelgeuse pulsating UV (HST).jpg|thumb|left|Ultraviolet image of Betelgeuse showing the star's asymmetrical pulsations, expansion and contraction]]
Betelgeuse is classified as a semiregular variable star of subgroup SRc; these are pulsating red supergiants with low-amplitude variations and periods of stable brightness.<ref name="AAVSO" /> Different hypotheses have been put forward to explain Betelgeuse's pulsations and their rhythm—which result in an [[absolute magnitude]] oscillation from −5.27 and −6.27.<ref name="absmagrges" group="note">This range of absolute magnitudes assumes an apparent magnitude that varies from 0.2 to 1.2 and a distance of 197&nbsp;pc.</ref> Established theories of stellar structure suggest that the outer layers of this [[supergiant]] gradually expand and contract, causing the surface area (photosphere) to alternately increase and decrease, and the temperature to rise and fall—thereby eliciting the measured cadence in the star's brightness between its dimmest magnitude of 1.2, seen as early as 1927, and its brightest of 0.2, seen in 1933 and 1942. A red supergiant like Betelgeuse will pulsate this way because its stellar atmosphere is unstable. As the star contracts, it absorbs more and more of the energy that passes through it, causing the atmosphere to heat up and expand. Conversely, as the star expands, its atmosphere becomes less dense, allowing the energy to escape and the atmosphere to cool, thus initiating a new contraction phase.<ref name="AAVSO" /> Calculating the star's pulsations and modeling its periodicity have been difficult, as it appears there are several cycles interlaced. As discussed in papers by Stebbins and Sanford in the 1930s, there are short-term variations of around 150 to 300&nbsp;days that modulate a regular cyclic variation with a period of roughly 5.7&nbsp;years.<ref name="GOLDBERG">{{cite journal

Consequently, if only a third of these convective cells are visible at any one time, the variations in their observable light emission may result in the recorded irregular brightness variations of the overall light from the star.<ref name="SCHWARZSCHILD1975" />

The hypothesis that gigantic convection cells dominate the surface of red giants and supergiants remains accepted by the astronomical community.

The precise diameter has been hard to define for several reasons:

Which part of the electromagnetic spectrum—the visible, near-infrared ([[Infrared#Astronomy division scheme|NIR]]) or mid-infrared (MIR)—produces the most accurate angular measurement is still debated.<ref name="NOTEANGULAR" group="note" /> In 1996, Manfred Bester, working with the ISI in the mid-infrared, led a team at the [[Space Sciences Laboratory]] (SSL) at [[University of California, Berkeley|U.C.

A team of astronomers working in the near-infrared and led by Guy Perrin of the [[Paris Observatory|Observatoire de Paris]] produced a 2004 document arguing that the more accurate photospheric measurement was 43.33 ± 0.04&nbsp;mas.<ref name="PERRIN2" /> The study also put forth an explanation as to why varying wavelengths from the visible to mid-infrared produce different diameters: the star is seen through a thick, warm extended atmosphere. At short wavelengths (the visible spectrum) the atmosphere scatters light, thus slightly increasing the star's diameter. At near-infrared wavelengths ([[Infrared astronomy#Modern infrared astronomy|K and L bands]]), the scattering is negligible, so the classical photosphere can be directly seen; in the mid-infrared the scattering increases once more causing the thermal emission of the warm atmosphere to increase the apparent diameter.<ref name="PERRIN2" /> [[File:Orion's Big Head Revealed in Infrared.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Infrared image of Betelgeuse, [[Meissa]] and [[Bellatrix]] with surrounding nebulas<ref name="NASA2">{{cite web

Central to this discussion is another paper published in 2009 by the Berkeley team, led by Charles Townes, reporting that the radius of Betelgeuse had shrunk from 1993 to 2009 by 15%, with the 2008 angular measurement equal to 47.0&nbsp;mas, not too far from Perrin's estimate.<ref name="TOWNES1" /><ref name="COWEN">{{cite web

Earlier studies have typically lasted one to two years by comparison and have explored multiple wavelengths, often yielding vastly different results. The diminution in Betelgeuse's [[apparent size]] equates to a range of values between 56.0&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.1&nbsp;mas seen in 1993 to 47.0&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.1&nbsp;mas seen in 2008—a contraction of almost 0.9&nbsp;AU in 15&nbsp;years. What is not fully known is whether this observation is evidence of a rhythmic expansion and contraction of the star's photosphere as astronomers have theorized, and if so, what the periodic cycle might be, although Townes suggested that if a cycle does exist, it is probably a few decades long.<ref name="TOWNES1" /> Other possible explanations are photospheric protrusions due to convection or a star that is not spherical but asymmetric causing the ''appearance'' of expansion and contraction as the star rotates on its axis.<ref name="COURTLAND">{{cite web

The debate about differences between measurements in the mid-infrared, which suggest a possible expansion and contraction of the star, and the near-infrared, which advocates a relatively constant photospheric diameter, remains to be resolved. In a paper published in 2012, the Berkeley team reported that their measurements were "dominated by the behavior of cool, optically thick material above the stellar photosphere," indicating that the apparent expansion and contraction may be due to activity in the star's outer shells and not the photosphere itself.<ref name="RAVI1" /> This conclusion, if further corroborated, would suggest an average angular diameter for Betelgeuse closer to Perrin's estimate at 43.33&nbsp;arcseconds, hence a stellar radius of about 3.4&nbsp;AU (730&nbsp;R<sub>☉</sub>) assuming the shorter Hipparcos distance of 498&nbsp;±&nbsp;73&nbsp;ly in lieu of Harper's estimate at 643&nbsp;±&nbsp;146&nbsp;ly. The [[Gaia (spacecraft)|Gaia spacecraft]] may clarify assumptions presently used in calculating the size of Betelgeuse's stellar disk.

Once considered as having the largest angular diameter of any star in the sky after the Sun, Betelgeuse lost that distinction in 1997 when a group of astronomers measured [[R Doradus]] with a diameter of 57.0 ± 0.5&nbsp;mas. Betelgeuse is now considered to be in third place, although R Doradus, being much closer to Earth at about 200&nbsp;ly, has a diameter roughly one-third that of Betelgeuse.<ref name="BEDDING">{{cite journal

Betelgeuse is a very large, luminous and cool star classified as a [[red supergiant]] of M2Iab class.

Uncertainties regarding the star's surface temperature, angular diameter and distance, make it difficult to achieve a precise measurement of Betelgeuse's luminosity.

Moreover, Betelgeuse's projected pathway does not appear to intersect with the [[25 Orionis|25 Ori]] [[Orion OB1 Association|subassociation]] or the far younger Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC, also known as Ori OB1d), particularly since [[Very Long Baseline Array]] astrometry yields a distance to the ONC between 389 and 414&nbsp;parsecs. Consequently, it is likely that Betelgeuse has not always had its current motion through space and has changed course at one time or another, possibly the result of a nearby [[Supernova|stellar explosion]].<ref name="HARPER" /><ref name="REYNOLDS1" />

The most likely star-formation scenario for Betelgeuse is that it is a [[Stellar kinematics#Runaway stars|runaway star]] from the [[Orion OB1 Association]]. Originally a member of a high-mass multiple system within Ori OB1a, Betelgeuse was probably formed about 10–12 million years ago from molecular clouds observed in Orion,<ref>{{cite web| author=Robert Nemiroff (MTU) & Jerry Bonnell (USRA)| title=Orion: Head to Toe | work=Today's [[Astronomy Picture of the Day]] | date=23 October 2010 | url=http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap101023.html | accessdate=8 October 2012}}</ref> but has evolved rapidly due to its high mass.<ref name="HARPER" />

Like many young stars in Orion whose mass is greater than 10&nbsp;M<sub>☉</sub>, Betelgeuse will use its fuel quickly and not live long. On the [[Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]], Betelgeuse has moved off the [[main sequence]] and has swelled and cooled to become a [[red supergiant]]. Although young, Betelgeuse has probably exhausted the hydrogen in its core—unlike its OB cousins born about the same time—causing it to contract under the force of gravity into a hotter and denser state. As a result, it has begun to fuse [[helium]] into [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]] producing enough radiation to unfurl its outer envelopes of [[hydrogen]] and helium. Its mass and luminosity are such that the star will eventually fuse higher elements through [[neon]], [[magnesium]], [[sodium]], and [[silicon]] all the way to [[iron]], at which point it will probably collapse and explode as a [[type II supernova]].<ref name="SOLSTATION" /><ref name="KALER">{{cite web

As an early M-type supergiant, Betelgeuse is one of the largest, [[List of most luminous stars|most luminous]] and yet one of the most ethereal stars known. A radius of 5.5&nbsp;AU is roughly 1,180 times the radius of the Sun—able to contain over 2 quadrillion Earths (2.15 × 10<sup>15</sup>) or more than 1.6 billion (1.65 × 10<sup>9</sup>) Suns. That is the equivalent of Betelgeuse being a football stadium like [[Wembley Stadium]] in London with the Earth a tiny [[pearl]], 1 millimeter in diameter, orbiting a Sun the size of a [[mango]].<ref name="NOTEVOLUME" group="note">For computations relating to ''Betelgeuse volume'', click [show].

{{Collapse|1= The analogy is based on the computation of certain ratios – specifically the diameter, radius and volume of the three celestial bodies in question, Betelgeuse, the Sun and Earth. Once these ratios are derived, the relative size of each as they relate to [[Wembley Stadium]] can be easily determined. The calculations begin with the formula for [[angular diameter]] as follows:
* Betelgeuse [[diameter]] ≈ 0.0552 [[arcseconds]] × 197.0 [[parsecs|pc]] ≈ 11.000 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] (rounded up) × 149,597,871&nbsp;km ≈ 1.646 ×10<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;km,
* Betelgeuse [[radius]] ≈ 11.000 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] ÷ 2 ≈ 5.500 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] × 149,597,871&nbsp;km ≈ 8.230 ×10<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;km ≈ 823,000,000&nbsp;km,
* Betelgeuse [[sphere|volume]] ≈ (4÷3×π) × 823,000,000<sup>3</sup> ≈ 2.335 × 10<sup>27</sup> km<sup>3</sup>.

Also:
* [[Sun|Solar]] radius ≈ 696,000&nbsp;km. Volume ≈ 1.412×10<sup>18</sup> km<sup>3</sup>,
* Earth radius ≈ 6,371.0&nbsp;km. Volume ≈ 1.083×10<sup>12</sup> km<sup>3</sup>.
* [[Wembley Stadium#Structure|Wembley Bowl Volume]] ≈ 1,139,100 m<sup>3</sup>. [[Sphere|Spherical radius]] ≈ (1,139,100m<sup>3</sup> ÷ (4/3*π))<sup>1/3</sup> ≈ 64.787 m or 64,787 mm.

Therefore:
* Betelgeuse ≈ (2.335 × 10<sup>27</sup>) ÷ (1.412×10<sup>18</sup>) ≈ 1.654 × 10<sup>9</sup> Suns,
* Betelgeuse ≈ (2.335 × 10<sup>27</sup>) ÷ (1.083×10<sup>12</sup>) ≈ 2.156 × 10<sup>15</sup> Earths.

* Solar volume relative to Wembley ≈ 1,139,100&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup> ÷ (1.654 × 10<sup>9</sup>) × 10<sup>9</sup>{i.e. to convert to mm<sup>3</sup>} ≈ 689,000 mm<sup>3</sup> (rounded up)
* Solar diameter relative to Wembley ≈ (689,000&nbsp;mm<sup>3</sup> ÷ (4/3*π))<sup>1/3</sup> ≈ 55.61845 × 2 ≈ 110&nbsp;mm
* Earth volume relative to Wembley ≈ 1,139,100&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup> ÷ (2.156 × 10<sup>15</sup>) × 10<sup>9</sup>{i.e. to convert to mm<sup>3</sup>} ≈ 0.528 mm<sup>3</sup>
* Earth diameter relative to Wembley ≈ (0.528 mm<sup>3</sup> ÷ (4/3*π))<sup>1/3</sup> ≈ 0.501 × 2 ≈ 1.002&nbsp;mm
* Earth's orbital radius (1&nbsp;AU) relative to Wembley ≈ 1&nbsp;AU ÷ 5.5&nbsp;AU × 64.787 meters = 11.8&nbsp;m

Conclusion:
* If the immense space of Wembley Stadium were Betelgeuse, the Earth would be a tiny [[pearl]], 1.0&nbsp;mm in diameter, orbiting a Sun, 11.0&nbsp;cm in diameter (i.e. the size of an average [[mango]] or [[grapefruit]]), with an orbital distance of about 11.8&nbsp;m. |bg=#F0F2F5}}</ref> Moreover, observations from 2009 of Betelgeuse exhibiting a 15% contraction in angular diameter would equate to a shortening of the star's radius from about 5.5 to 4.6&nbsp;AU, assuming that the photosphere is a perfect sphere. A reduction of this magnitude would correspond to a diminution in photospheric volume of about 41%.<ref name="NOTEREDUCTION" group="note">For computations relating to ''stellar contraction'', click [show].{{Collapse|1=
As pointed out in the [[Betelgeuse#Angular anomalies|Angular anomalies]] section, the observed contraction could be due to a shrinking of the star's radius or by other phenomena. Assuming the photosphere is spherical, calculating a reduction in volume begins with the formula for [[angular diameter]] as follows:
Calculations for 1993 values:
* Betelgeuse [[radius]] ≈ 0.056&nbsp;[[arcseconds]] × 197.0&nbsp;[[parsecs|pc]] ≈ 11.032&nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] ÷ 2 ≈ 5.516&nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] × 149,597,871&nbsp;km ≈ 825,000,000&nbsp;km,
* Betelgeuse [[sphere|volume]] ≈ (4÷3×π) × 825,000,000<sup>3</sup> ≈ 2.352 × 10<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>.
Calculations for 2008 values:
* Betelgeuse [[radius]] ≈ 0.047&nbsp;[[arcseconds]] × 197.0&nbsp;[[parsecs|pc]] ≈ 9.260&nbsp;AU ÷ 2 ≈ 4.630&nbsp;AU × 149,597,871&nbsp;km ≈ 692,500,000&nbsp;km,
* Betelgeuse [[sphere|volume]] ≈ (4÷3×π) × 692,500,000<sup>3</sup> ≈ 1.391 × 10<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>.
Therefore:
* Betelgeuse change in volume ≈ 2.352 × 10<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> – 1.391 × 10<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> ≈ –9.610E × 10<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>
* Betelgeuse percent change in volume ≈ –9.610E × 10<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> ÷ 2.352 × 10<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> ≈ –40.86%
* Betelgeuse volume change as a function of Solar volume ≈ –9.610E × 10<sup>26</sup> ÷ 1.412×10<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> ≈ –681,000,000 Suns.|bg=#F0F2F5}}

=== Circumstellar dynamics ===

In the late phase of [[stellar evolution]], massive stars like Betelgeuse exhibit high rates of [[stellar mass loss|mass loss]], possibly as much as 1&nbsp;M<sub>☉</sub> every 10,000 years, resulting in a complex [[circumstellar envelope|circumstellar environment]] that is constantly in flux.<ref name="ESO0927"/> In a 2009 paper, stellar mass loss was cited as the "key to understanding the evolution of the universe from the earliest cosmological times to the current epoch, and of planet formation and the formation of life itself.<ref name="RIDGEWAY">

As a result of work done by Pierre Kervella and his team at the [[Paris observatory]], astronomers may be close to solving this mystery. They noticed a large plume of gas extending outward at least six times the stellar radius indicating that Betelgeuse is not shedding matter evenly in all directions.<ref name="KERVELLA2009" /><ref name="ESO0927" /> The plume's presence implies that the spherical symmetry of the star's photosphere, often observed in the infrared, is ''not'' preserved in its close environment. Asymmetries on the stellar disk had been reported at different wavelengths. However, due to the refined capabilities of the [[Very Large Telescope#Instruments|NACO]] adaptive optics on the VLT, these asymmetries have come into focus. The two mechanisms that could cause such asymmetrical mass loss, Kervella noted, were large-scale convection cells or polar mass loss, possibly due to rotation.<ref name="KERVELLA2009" /> Probing deeper with ESO's AMBER, Keiichi Ohnaka and colleagues observed that the gas in the supergiant's extended atmosphere is vigorously moving up and down, creating bubbles as large as the supergiant itself, leading his team to conclude that such stellar upheaval is behind the massive plume ejection observed by Kervella.<ref name="ESO0927" /><ref name="OHNAKA2009">

==== Asymmetric shells ====

In addition to the photosphere, six other components of Betelgeuse's atmosphere have now been identified. They are a molecular environment otherwise known as the MOLsphere, a gaseous envelope, a chromosphere, a dust environment and two outer shells (S1 and S2) composed of [[carbon monoxide]] (CO). Some of these elements are known to be asymmetric while others overlap.<ref name="HAUBOIS" />

At about 0.45 stellar radii (~2–3&nbsp;AU) above the photosphere there may lie a molecular layer known as the MOLsphere or  molecular environment.

The first attestation of a dust shell surrounding Betelgeuse was put forth by Sutton and colleagues, who noted in 1977 that dust shells around mature stars often emit large amounts of radiation in excess of the photospheric contribution. Using [[Interferometry#Heterodyne detection|heterodyne interferometry]], they concluded that the red supergiant emits most of its excess beyond 12 stellar radii or roughly the distance of the [[Kuiper belt]] at 50 to 60 AU, depending on the assumed stellar radius.<ref name="SUTTON1977"/><ref name="HAUBOIS"/> Since then, there have been studies done of this dust envelope at varying wavelengths yielding decidedly different results. Studies from the 1990s have estimated the inner radius of the dust shell anywhere from 0.5 to 1.0&nbsp;arcseconds, or 100 to 200&nbsp;AU.<ref name="SKINNER">

The sun's [[heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]] is estimated at about 100 AU, so the size of this outer shell would be almost fourteen times the size of the Solar System.

=== Approaching supernova ===
The fate of Betelgeuse depends on its mass—a critical factor which is not well understood.<ref name="GRAY1" /> Since most investigators posit a mass greater than 10&nbsp;M<sub>☉</sub>, the most likely scenario is that the supergiant will continue to burn and fuse elements until its core is iron, at which point Betelgeuse will explode as a type II supernova. During this event the core will collapse, leaving behind a [[neutron star]] remnant about 20&nbsp;km in diameter.<ref name="100greatest" /> [[File:Betelgeuse supernova.png|thumb|left|[[Celestia]]'s computerized depiction of Orion as it might appear from Earth should Betelgeuse explode as a [[supernova]]]] [[File:Chandra Gamma Ray Burst 01.jpg|thumb|left|Artist depiction of a [[Gamma-ray burst]] showing jets and supernova shell<ref name="CHANDRA1">{{cite web

In 1985, Margarita Karovska, in conjunction with other astrophysicists at the [[Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]], announced the discovery of two close companions orbiting Betelgeuse. Analysis of [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] data from 1968 through 1983 indicated a close companion with a periodic orbit of about 2.1 years. Using speckle interferometry, the team concluded that the closer of the two companions was located at 0.06 ± 0.01" (~9 AU) from the main star with a position angle (PA) of 273 degrees, an orbit that would potentially place it within the star's chromosphere. The more distant companion was estimated at 0.51 ± 0.01" (~77 AU) with a PA of 278 degrees.<ref name="KAROVSKA1">{{cite journal

In the years that followed no confirmation of Karovska's discovery was published. In 1992, a team of collaborators from the Cavendish Astrophysics Group questioned the finding. They published a paper noting that the brightness features on the surface of Betelgeuse appear to be "too bright to be associated with a passage of the suggested companions in front of the red giant." They also noticed that these features were fainter at 710 nanometers compared to 700 by a factor of 1.8, indicating that such features would have to reside within the molecular atmosphere of the star.<ref name="WILSON2">{{cite journal

The last part of the name, "-elgeuse", comes from the Arabic {{lang|ar|الجوزاء}} ''{{transl|ar|al-Jauzā'}}'', a historical Arabic name of the constellation Orion, a feminine name in old [[Arabian legend]], and of uncertain meaning.

=== Mythology ===

With the [[history of astronomy]] intimately associated with [[mythology]] and [[astrology]] before the [[scientific revolution]], the red star, like the planet Mars that derives its name from a [[Mars (mythology)|Roman war god]], has been closely associated with the [[wikt:martial|martial]] [[archetype]] of conquest for millennia, and by extension, the motif of death and rebirth.<ref name="allen" /> Other cultures have produced different myths. Stephen R. Wilk has proposed the constellation of Orion could have represented the Greek mythological figure [[Pelops]], who had an artificial shoulder of ivory made for him, with Betelgeuse as the shoulder, its color reminiscent of the reddish yellow sheen of ivory.<ref name="wilk99" />

In the Americas, Betelgeuse signifies a severed limb of a man-figure (Orion)—the [[Pemon people|Taulipang]] of Brazil know the constellation as Zililkawai, a hero whose leg was cut off by his wife, with the variable light from Betelgeuse linked to the severing of the limb. Similarly, the [[Lakota people]] of North America see it as a chief whose arm has been severed.<ref name="wilk99">{{cite journal|last=Wilk|first=Stephen R.|year=1999|title=Further Mythological Evidence for Ancient Knowledge of Variable Stars|journal= The Journal of the American Association of Variable Star Observers|volume=27|issue=2|pages=171–74|bibcode=1999JAVSO..27..171W}}</ref> The [[Wardaman people]] of northern Australia knew the star as ''Ya-jungin'' "Owl Eyes Flicking", its variable light signifying its intermittent watching of ceremonies led by the Red Kangaroo Leader Rigel.<ref>{{cite book  | last1 = Harney  | first1 = Bill Yidumduma

A Sanskrit name for Betelgeuse was ''ãrdrã'' "the moist one", eponymous of the [[Ardra (nakshatra)|''Ardra'']] [[nakshatra|lunar mansion]] in [[Hindu astrology]].<ref name="motz">{{cite book|last=Motz|first=Lloyd|coauthors=Nathanson, Carol|title=The Constellations: An Enthusiast's Guide to the Night Sky|publisher=Aurum Press|location=London, United Kingdom|year=1991|page=85|isbn=1-85410-088-2}}</ref> The [[Rigvedic deities|Rigvedic God]] of storms [[Rudra]] presided over the star; this association was linked by 19th century star enthusiast [[Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning|Richard Hinckley Allen]] to Orion's stormy nature.<ref name="allen" /> The constellations in Macedonian folklore represented agricultural items and animals, reflecting their village way of life. To them, Betelgeuse was ''Orach'' "the ploughman", alongside the rest of Orion which depicted a plough with oxen. The rising of Betelgeuse at around 3&nbsp;am in late summer and autumn signified the time for village men to go to the fields and plough.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Macedonian Folk Constellations |author=Cenev, Gjore |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Observatory of Belgrade|volume= 85|pages=97–109|bibcode=2008POBeo..85...97C|year=2008}}</ref> To the Inuit, the appearance of Betelgeuse and Bellatrix high in the southern sky after sunset marked the beginning of spring and lengthening days in late February and early March. The two stars were known as ''Akuttujuuk'' "those (two) placed far apart", referring to the distance between them, mainly to people from North Baffin Island and Melville Peninsula.<ref name=inuit/>

The opposed locations of Orion and Scorpio, with their corresponding bright variable red stars Betelgeuse and Antares, were noted by ancient cultures around the world. The setting of Orion and rising of Scorpio signify the death of Orion by the scorpion. In China they signify brothers and rivals Shen and Shang.<ref name="wilk99" /> The [[Batak (Indonesia)|Batak]] of Sumatra marked their New Year with the first new moon after the sinking of Orion's Belt below the horizon, at which point Betelgeuse remained "like the tail of a rooster". The positions of Betelgeuse and Antares at opposite ends of the celestial sky were considered significant and their constellations were seen as a pair of scorpions. Scorpion days marked as nights that both constellations could be seen.<ref name="kelley11">{{cite book|last=Kelley, David H.; Milone, Eugene F.; Aveni, A.F. |title=Exploring Ancient Skies: A Survey of Ancient and Cultural Astronomy|publisher=Springer|location=New York, New York|year=2011|pages=307|isbn=144197623X|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ILBuYcGASxcC&pg=PA307&dq=Betelgeuse+legend#v=onepage&q=Betelgeuse%20&f=false}}</ref>

=== In popular culture ===
{{see also|Betelgeuse in fiction}}

The star's unusual name inspired the 1988 film ''[[Beetlejuice]]'', and script writer [[Michael McDowell (author)|Michael McDowell]] was impressed by how many people made the connection. He added that they had received a suggestion the sequel be named ''Sanduleak-69 202'' after the former star of [[SN 1987A]].<ref name="schaaf" /><!-- ref cites two previous sentences --> In [[August Derleth]]'s short story "The Dweller in the Darkness" set in [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Cthulhu Mythos]], Betelgeuse is the home of the 'benign' [[Elder God (Cthulhu Mythos)|Elder Gods]].<ref name="conley" /> The identity of the red star Borgil mentioned in ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' was much debated and [[Aldebaran]], Betelgeuse and the planet Mars were touted as candidates. Professor Kristine Larsen has concluded the evidence points to it being Aldebaran as it precedes Menelvagor (Orion).<ref>{{cite journal

Two American navy ships were named after the star, both World War II vessels, the {{USS|Betelgeuse|AKA-11}} launched in 1939 and {{USS|Betelgeuse|AK-260}} launched in 1944. In 1979, a French supertanker named ''[[Betelgeuse incident|Betelgeuse]]'' was moored off [[Whiddy Island]] discharging oil when it exploded, killing 50 people in one of the worst disasters in Ireland's history.<ref>{{cite news
