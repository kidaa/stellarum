'''Pleione''' ('''28 Tauri''', '''BU Tauri''') is a [[binary star]] in the [[Pleiades (star cluster)|Pleiades]] [[open cluster|star cluster]] ([[Messier objects|M45]]), located roughly 390 [[light year]]s away in the [[constellation]] of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]. Pleione was not given a [[Bayer designation]], but did receive a [[Flamsteed number]]&mdash;hence its designation 28 Tauri. Since the star is located close to [[Atlas (star)|Atlas]], it's difficult for stargazers to distinguish with the naked eye, even though it's a hot [[B-type star|type B]] star 190 times more luminous than the [[Sun]]. Pleione rotates even faster than [[Achernar]] on its axis, close to its [[Stellar rotation#Equatorial bulge|breakup velocity]].

The brighter star of the binary pair, component A, is a classical [[Be star]] with certain distinguishing traits: periodic phase changes and a complex circumstellar environment composed of two gaseous disks at different angles to each other. Although some research on the system has been performed, stellar characteristics of the orbiting B component are not well known.<ref>See the section [[Pleione (star)#Star system|Star system]] for further information</ref> Pleione is the [[Pleiades (star cluster)#Brightest stars in Pleiades|seventh brightest]] star in the Pleiades, after [[Taygeta (star)|Taygeta]].

With an [[apparent magnitude]] of +5.05 in [[UBV photometric system|V]], the star is rather difficult to make out with the naked eye, especially since its close neighbour [[Atlas (star)|Atlas]] is 3.7 times brighter and located less than 5 [[arcminute]]s away.<ref name="NOTEATLAS" group="note">The brightness ratio of Atlas versus Pleione is derived from the [[Apparent magnitude#Calculations|formula for apparent magnitude]] and is based on their respective [[UBV photometric system|visual]] [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]]s: Atlas '''(<math>{m_A}</math>)''' at 3.62 and Pleione '''(<math>{m_P}</math>)''' at 5.05. Therefore:

Even in cities like [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], at the tip of the [[Africa]]n [[continent]], the star rises almost 32° above the [[horizon]]. Due to its declination of roughly +24°, Pleione is [[Circumpolar star|circumpolar]] in the [[northern hemisphere]] at latitudes greater than 66° North. Once late April arrives, the cluster can be spotted briefly in the deepening [[twilight]] of the western horizon, soon to disappear with the other setting stars.<ref name="ASTRONOMYMAGAZINE">

===Etymology===
When names were assigned to the stars in the Pleiades cluster, the bright pair of stars in the East of the cluster were named Atlas and Pleione, while the seven other bright stars were named after the [[mythology|mythological]] Pleiades (the 'Seven Sisters'). The term "Pleiades" was used by [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]] to apply to the cluster as a whole, and [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli|Riccioli]] called the star ''Mater Pleione''.<ref name="ALLEN">

There is some diversity of opinion as to the origin of the names Pleione and Pleiades. There are three possible derivations of note. Foremost is that both names come from the Greek word πλεῖν, ''(pr. ple'-ō)'', meaning "to sail".<ref name="ALLEN"/><ref name="GIBSON">

}}</ref> This is particularly plausible given that ancient Greece was a seafaring culture and because of Pleione's [[myth]]ical status as an Oceanid nymph. Pleione, as a result, is sometimes referred to as the "sailing queen" while her daughters the "sailing ones". Also, the appearance of these stars coincided with the sailing season in antiquity; sailors were well advised to set sail only when the Pleiades were visible at night, lest they meet with misfortune.<ref name=" FRAZER">

Another derivation of the name is the Greek word Πλειόνη<ref name="SMITH">

This meaning also coincides with the biblical Kīmāh and the Arabic word for the Pleiades — Al Thurayya.<ref name=" ALLEN " /> In fact, Pleione may have been numbered amongst the [[Epimelides]] (nymphs of meadows and pastures) and presided over the multiplication of the animals, as her name means "to increase in number".<ref name="THEOI">

Finally, the last comes from [[Peleiades]] ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Πελειάδες}}, "[[dove]]s"), a reference to the sisters' mythical transformation by [[Zeus]] into a flock of doves following their pursuit by [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]], the [http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap100329.html giant huntsman], across the heavens.<ref name="HESIOD">

===Modern legacy===
In the best-selling 1955 [[nature]] book published by [[Time-Life]] called ''[[The World We Live In]]'', there is an artist's impression of Pleione entitled ''Purple Pleione''.<ref>

Where the excited gas crosses Pleione's equator, it obscures her violet light."

Given its mythical connection with [[sailing]] and [[Pleione (orchid)|orchid]]s, the name Pleione is often associated with grace, speed and elegance. Some of the finest designs in racing [[yacht]]s have the name Pleione,<ref name="DYSON">
