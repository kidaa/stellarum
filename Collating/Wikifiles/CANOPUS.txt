[[File:Canopus seen from Tokyo.jpg|thumb|250px|Canopus seen from [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. The latitude is 35°38′N.]]

'''Canopus''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|n|oʊ|p|ə|s}}; α Car, α Carinae, [[alpha (letter)|Alpha]] Carinae) is the brightest [[star]] in the southern [[constellation]] of [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]] and [[Argo Navis]], and the [[list of brightest stars|second brightest star]] in the night-time sky, after [[Sirius]]. Canopus's [[visual magnitude]] is &minus;0.72, and it has an [[absolute magnitude]] of &minus;5.53.

Canopus is a supergiant of [[spectral type]] F. Canopus is essentially white when seen with the naked eye (although F-type stars are sometimes listed as "yellowish-white"). It is located in the far southern sky, at a [[declination]] of &minus;52°&nbsp;42' (2000) and a [[right ascension]] of 06h24.0m.<ref name=simbada/>

==Observational history==
One of the least famous of the brightest stars, Canopus was not visible to the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] and [[Roman Empire|Romans]]; it was, however, visible to the [[Ancient Egypt|Ancient Egyptians]].<ref name=Schaaf107>Schaaf, p. 107.</ref>  It is also referred to by its [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name: سهيل (''Suhayl''), given by [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Islamic scientists]] in the 7th Century CE.

==Visibility==
In the southern hemisphere, Canopus and Sirius are both visible high in the sky simultaneously, and reach the meridian just 21 minutes apart.  It is a [[circumpolar star]] when seen from points that have latitude south of 37°18' south; for example, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]], Australia; [[Auckland]] and south of it, New Zealand; [[Bahía Blanca]], Argentina; and [[Valdivia, Chile]] and south of these cities in [[South America]]. Since Canopus is so far south in the sky, it never rises in mid- or far-northern latitudes; in theory the northern limit of visibility is latitude 37°18' north.   This is just south of [[Athens]], [[Richmond (Virginia)|Richmond (USA)]],  and [[San Francisco]], and very close to [[Seville]]. It is almost exactly the latitude of [[Lick Observatory]] on Mt. Hamilton, California, from which it is readily visible due to the effects of elevation and [[atmospheric refraction]], which add another degree to its apparent altitude.    Under ideal conditions it has been spotted as far north as  latitude 37°31' from the Pacific coast.<ref>D. Gieringer, "Exploring the Tropic of Canopus," ''Astronomy'', December 1985, p.24.</ref>  It is more easily visible in places such as the Gulf Coast and Florida, and is best viewed around 9 p.m. on February 6.<ref name="motz">{{cite book|last=Motz|first=Lloyd|coauthors=Nathanson, Carol|title=The Constellations: An Enthusiast's Guide to the Night Sky|publisher=Aurum Press|location=London, United Kingdom|year=1991|pages=376–77|isbn=1-85410-088-2}}</ref>

Most visible in the southern hemisphere summer, Canopus culminates at midnight on December 27,<ref name="motz"/> and at 9PM on February 11.<ref name=Schaaf257>Schaaf, p. 257.</ref>

F-type supergiants have been described as yellow-white or white.{{cn|date=July 2012}} Canopus has a B-V [[color index]] of 0.16 where 0 is a blue-white, indicating it is essentially white, although has been described as yellow-white. Its spectral type has been recorded as either F0 or sometimes A9. It has less yellow than Altair or Procyon, whose color indexes have been measured at 0.22 and 0.42 respectively. Author Fred Schaaf has proposed that some observers have seen it yellow-tinged due to it being located low in the sky and hence an atmospheric effect.<ref name=Schaaf112>Schaaf, pp. 112-13.</ref>

==Physical properties==
Before the launch of the [[Hipparcos]] satellite telescope, distance estimates for the star varied widely, from 96 light years to 1200 light years. Had the latter distance been correct, Canopus would have been one of the most luminous stars in our galaxy. Hipparcos established Canopus as lying 310 [[light year]]s (96 [[parsec]]s) from our [[solar system]]; this is based on a [[parallax]] measurement of  10.43 ± 0.53 [[milliarcsecond|mas]].<ref name=simbada/> The difficulty in measuring Canopus' distance stemmed from its unusual nature. Canopus has been classified as a F0&nbsp;II or F0&nbsp;Ib (Ib referring to "less luminous supergiant") star,<ref name=desouza>{{cite doi|10.1051/0004-6361:200810450}}</ref> and such stars are rare and poorly understood; they are stars that can be either in the process of evolving to or away from [[red giant]] status.<ref name="100greatest">{{cite book |title=The Hundred Greatest Stars|author=Kaler, James B. |year=2002 |publisher=Copernicus Books |location=New York |isbn=0-387-95436-8|page=37}}</ref> This in turn made it difficult to know how intrinsically bright Canopus is, and therefore how far away it might be. Direct measurement was the only way to solve the problem. Canopus is too far away for Earth-based parallax observations to be made, so the star's distance was not known with certainty until the early 1990s.

The surface temperature of Canopus has been estimated at 7350 ± 30 K.<ref name="Desikachary82">{{cite journal|author=Desikachary K, Hearnshaw JB|year=1982|title=The spectrum of Canopus. II - Analysis and composition |journal=Royal Astronomical Society, Monthly Notices |volume=201 |pages=707–21|format=PDF|bibcode=1982MNRAS.201..707D}}</ref>

Infrared interferometry was used to calculate its angular diameter at 6.93 ± 0.15 mas. Combined with distance calculated by Hipparcos, this gives it a diameter of 71.4 ± 0.4 times that of the sun.<ref name=desouza/>   If it were placed at the centre of our solar system, it would extend 90% of the way to the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].<ref name=Kalerstars>{{cite web|url=http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/canopus.html|title=Canopus|last=Kaler|first=Jim|work=Stars|publisher=University of Illinois|accessdate=8 July 2012|date=26 June 2009}} </ref>

Canopus is the most intrinsically bright star within approximately 700 light years, and it has been the brightest star in Earth's sky during three different epochs over the past four million years.<ref>''[[Sky and Telescope]]'', April 1998 (p60), based on computations from [[HIPPARCOS]] data.</ref>  Other stars appear brighter only during relatively temporary periods, during which they are passing our solar system at a much closer distance than Canopus.  About 90,000 years ago, [[Sirius]] moved close enough that it became brighter than Canopus, and that will remain the case for another 210,000 years.  But in 480,000 years, Canopus will once again be the brightest, and will remain so for a period of about 510,000 years. {{Dubious|date=June 2012}}

Canopus is part of the [[Scorpius-Centaurus Association]], a group of stars which share similar origins.<ref name="100greatest"/>

Canopus is a strong source of X-rays, which are probably produced by its corona, magnetically heated to around 15 million K. The temperature has likely been stimulated by fast rotation combined with strong convection percolating through the star's outer layers. The star's surface temperature is too cool to account for the X-rays.<ref name="100greatest"/>

==Etymology and cultural significance==
The name "Canopus" is a Latinisation of the [[Ancient Greek]] name Κάνωβος/"Kan&ocirc;bos", recorded in Claudius Ptolemy's [[Almagest]] (c150 AD). Eratosthenes used this spelling, however Hipparchos wrote it as Κάνωπος. [[John Flamsteed]] wrote Canobus.<ref>{{cite book|last=Flamsteed|first=John|title=Atlas coelestis|location=London, United Kingdom|date=1729|pages=Constellation Map of Southern Hemisphere.|url=http://lhldigital.lindahall.org/u?/astro_atlas,1191}}</ref> The name has two common derivations, both listed in [[Richard Hinckley Allen]]'s seminal ''[[Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning]]'';<ref name="hinkley63">{{cite book|first=Richard Hinckley | last=Allen|authorlink=Richard Hinckley Allen|year=1963|origyear=1899|title=Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning|pages=67–72|edition=Revised|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|isbn=0-486-21079-0}}</ref> and one less so.  All are matters of conjecture:

* One from the legend of the [[Trojan War]], where the constellation Carina was once part of the now-obsolete constellation of [[Argo Navis]], which represented the ship used by [[Jason]] and the Argonauts. The brightest star in the constellation was given the name of a ship's pilot from another Greek legend: [[Canopus (mythology)|Canopus]], pilot of [[Menelaus]]' ship on his quest to retrieve [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] of Troy after she was taken by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]].
* A second from the Egyptian [[Coptic language|Coptic]] ''Kahi Nub'' ("Golden Earth"), which refers how Canopus would have appeared near the horizon in ancient [[Egypt]], reddened by atmospheric extinction from that position.<ref name="hinkley63"/> A ruined ancient Egyptian port named [[Canopus (Egypt)|Canopus]] lies near the mouth of the [[Nile]], site of the [[Battle of the Nile]].
* A third is its possible origin from the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] root G(C)-N-B (Gimmel-Nun-Beth){{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}, from which the Arabic word for south, janūb ( جنوب ), is derived. The southeastern wall of the Muslim Ka'bah points to Canopus, and is named Janūb ("south") as well.<ref>{{cite web|last= Islamic Awareness |title= Astronomical Orientation Of Ka`bah |url= http://www.islamic-awareness.org/History/Islam/Dome_Of_The_Rock/qibla.html#3}}</ref>

Canopus was known to the ancient Mesopotamians and given the name ''NUN-ki'' and represented the city of Eridu in the ''Three Stars Each'' [[Babylonian star catalogues]] and later [[MUL.APIN]] around 1100 BC.<ref> {{cite journal  | last = Rogers  | first = John H.  | year = 1998  | title = Origins of the Ancient Constellations: I.

An occasional name seen in English is ''Soheil'', or the feminine Soheila; in Turkish is ''Süheyl'', or the feminine Süheyla, from the Arabic name for several bright stars, سهيل ''suhayl'',<ref name="hinkley63"/> and Canopus was known as Suhel in medieval times.<ref name=kunitzsch/> Alternate spellings include Suhil, Suhilon, Sohayl, Shoel, Sohil, Soheil, Sahil, Sihel, and Sihil.<ref name="hinkley63"/> An alternate name was ''Wazn'' "weight" or ''Haḍar'' "ground", possibly related to its low position near the horizon.<ref name="hinkley63"/> Hence comes its name in the ''Alphonsine Tables'', Suhel ponderosus, a Latinization of ''Al Suhail al Wazn''.<ref name="hinkley63"/> Its Greek name was revived during the Renaissance.<ref name=kunitzsch>{{cite book |author= Kunitzsch, Paul; Smart, Tim|year = 2006|title = A Dictionary of Modern star Names: A Short Guide to 254 Star Names and Their Derivations |edition = 2nd rev.  |publisher = [[New Track Media#Sky Publishing|Sky Pub]] |location = [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts|MA]] |isbn = 978-1-931559-44-7 |page = 23}}</ref>

In Ancient Hindu astronomy and astrology, Canopus is named Agasti or [[Agastya]].<ref name="hinkley63"/>

In traditional Tibetan astronomy and astrology, Canopus is named Karma Rishi སྐར་མ་རི་ཥི།  

''[[Kalīla o Damna]]'', an influential Pahlavi (Middle [[Persian literature|Persian]]) book of animal [[fables]] was later known as ''[[Anvar-i-Suhaili]]'' or ''[[The Lights of Canopus]]''.

===Role in navigation===
To anyone living in the northern hemisphere, but far enough south to see the star, it served as a southern [[pole star]]. This lasted only until [[magnetic compass]]es became common.

In modern times, Canopus serves another navigational use. Canopus' brightness and location well off the ecliptic makes it popular for space navigation. Many spacecraft carry a special camera known as a "Canopus [[star tracker|Star Tracker]]" plus a sun sensor for [[Orientation (geometry)|attitude]] determination.

The effects of [[precession]] will take Canopus within 10° of the south celestial pole around the year 14,000 AD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/moonkmft/Articles/Precession.html |title=Precession |author=Kieron Taylor |publisher=myweb.tiscali.co.uk |date=1 March 1994 |accessdate=2012-02-25}}</ref>

To the [[Negev Bedouins|Bedouin]] people of the [[Negev]] and [[Sinai]], Canopus is known as ''Suhayl''. It and Polaris are the two principal stars used for navigation at night. Due to the fact that it disappears below the horizon, it became associated with a cowardly or changeable nature, as opposed to always-visible [[Polaris]], which was circumpolar and hence 'steadfast'.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bailey |first=Clinton |year=1974 |title=Bedouin Star-Lore in Sinai and the Negev |journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=580–96 |accessdate=2008-01-14 |format=abstract |doi=10.1017/S0041977X00127491 |jstor=613801}}</ref>

The [[Tswana people]] of [[Botswana]] knew Canopus as ''Naka''. Appearing late in winter skies, it heralded increasing winds and a time when trees lose their leaves. Stock owners knew it was time to mate their sheep with a ram.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Clegg|first=Andrew|date=1986|title=Some Aspects of Tswana Cosmology|journal=Botswana Notes and Records|volume=18|pages=33-37|jstor=40979758 }}</ref>

To the [[ǀXam language|ǀXam]] speaking [[Bushmen]] of South Africa, Canopus and Sirius signalled the appearance of termites and flying ants. They also believed stars had the power to cause death and misfortune, and they would pray to Sirius and Canopus in particular to impart good fortune or skill.<ref>{{cite journal| title="The Sky's Things", <nowiki>|</nowiki>xam Bushman 'Astrological Mythology' as recorded in the Bleek and Lloyd Manuscripts |author=Hollman, J.

===In popular culture===
The fictional desert planet Arrakis featured in the Dune series of novels by Frank Herbert is the third planet orbiting Canopus.

In the MMORPG Eve Online, the titular wormhole which led to the galaxy the player's experience set place in, was located in the Canopus system.
