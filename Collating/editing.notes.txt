-------------

Going through all the stars in sequence, checking that their coordinates are
correct, and setting cross-references and removing 'q.v.'s.

The coordinates have to be changed in the spreadsheet.

The cross-references and qvs need to be changed in the json output - so
this may need some kind of overlay file so that the edits don't get clobbbered
when I re-run the coordinates.


Hand edits required:

ALTARF and ALTERF link to one another, but not by name

DSCHUBBA = BATENTABANS hand link, PHACD is misspelt
EL NATH links to itself

Mekbudah!
