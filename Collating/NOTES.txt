- Make sure that great circle paths between stars are not going the
  long way round.

- fadein with opacity for stars appearing 

- on text completion - add a highlight border to all matching stars


quick rotations:

(1) store unit vectors x, y, z for all stars

(2) when rendering: (a) generate a rotation matrix
                    (b) apply the matrix to each (x, y, z) and render

Because I'm using isometric rendering, simplify (b) as much as
possible.


* the geo interpolator expects degrees, not radians.  Fixed the "long
  way round" problem but there are some weird effects when a great
  circle passes near a celestial pole. May have to use quaternions
  after all.
